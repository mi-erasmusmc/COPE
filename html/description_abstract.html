<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;"><em>Background:</em> The COVID-19 pandemic is putting extraordinary pressure on emergency departments (EDs). Clinical prediction models have the potential to support decision making about hospital admission, but currently available models were recently assessed to contain a high risk of bias. We aimed to develop simple and valid models for predicting mortality and need for ICU in patients who are suspected to have COVID-19 when presenting at the ED.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;"><em>Methods:</em> We included patients that presented at the ED and were admitted to 4 large Dutch hospitals with suspected COVID-19. Patients being transferred from or to other hospitals were excluded since information on predictors or outcomes was missing. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital death and admission to ICU. Based on prior literature we included patient characteristics (sex, age, BMI), vital parameters (oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate [RR], body temperature) and blood test values (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactic dehydrogenase [LDH], D-Dimer, lymphocytes, and leucocytes), all measured at ED admission, as potential predictors. Further we included month of admission to capture changes in outcomes over time. Fine & Grey competing risk regression was used to obtain predicted probabilities of death and of being admitted to the ICU, both within 21 days after admission, accounting for discharge from the hospital. We used multiple imputation to account for missing predictor values. Model performance was assessed with leave-one-hospital-out cross-validation. We assessed discriminative ability with the c-index and calibration with calibration plots, calibration intercepts, and calibration slopes.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;"><em>Results:</em> The data included 4,612 patients who presented at the ED and were admitted to 4 hospitals, of whom 495 (10.7%) died and 3,632 (78.8%) were discharged within 21-days after admission. A simple model with linear age and logarithmic transforms of RR, CRP and LDH captured most of the ability to predict death within 21 days. Patients who were admitted in the first month of the pandemic in the Netherlands had substantially increased risk of death (sub-distribution hazard ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.31-1.88), which will be ignored when making future predictions. The model for predicting death was well-calibrated and showed good discrimination across 4 hospitals (c-indexes 0.79; 0.80; 0.83; 0.84).

Admission to ICU was fully recorded for 2,331 patients in 2 hospitals (196 ICU admissions within 21 days). The same predictors captured most of the ability to predict ICU admission within 21 days. However, after the age of 70, the probability of being admitted to the ICU was decreasing with age, probably reflecting the decision not to admit older patients to the ICU. To predict the need for ICU admission – rather than historically observed ICU admission – we kept a linear (decreasing) age effect after the age of 70 in the model, which will be ignored when making future predictions. Both calibration and discrimination of the model for predicting ICU admission were moderate in patients below the age of 70 in 2 hospitals (c-indexes 0.70 and 0.82).

The models are implemented as a web-based application.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;"><em>Conclusion:</em> A simple model, based on 4 routinely measured predictors in the ED, is well able to predict mortality and ICU admission for patients who present to the ED with suspected COVID-19. The model may help to inform patients and doctors when deciding on hospital admission.</p>
