<p style="text-align:left;">The presented model on this website for predicting the probability of death or ICU admission within the first 21 days after hospital admission for patients who are suspected to have COVID-19 when presenting at the ED, is the result of carefully conducted research. This model is developed and cross-validated based on data of four large hospitals in the Netherlands. Before you use this app make sure that you read the background information under the <b><em>Description tab</em></b>, which will help you to interpret its output.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:left;">As a model can never replace clinical judgement, it can only be used as a decision-support tool. This decision tool should be used exclusively by health care professionals as a complementary tool to predict the probability of death and ICU admission in patients who present at the Emergency Department with suspected COVID-19. Any responsibility for using this model and its results will rest solely by the health care professional using the model. Using it you should understand and agree that this site is not responsible or liable for any claim, loss, or damage resulting from its use. While we try to keep the information on the site as accurate as possible, we disclaim any warranty concerning its accuracy, timeliness, and completeness, and any other warranty, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
