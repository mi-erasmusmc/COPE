       <p style="font-size:15px;">The evaluation metrics are all based on temporal validation in second wave patients, that is, COPE was fitted in first wave patients admitted until August 2020 and validated in second wave patients admitted since September 2020 Calibration plots visualize the agreement between predicted and observed 28-day mortality / ICU admission in five equally-sized groups of predicted risk. The calibration intercept (a; ideally a=0) indicates the level of average underestimation (a&gt0) or overestimation (a&lt0) of the model.The calibration slope (b; ideally b=1) indicates a weaker than expected strength of the association between the predictors and the outcome (b&lt1; “overfitting”) or a stronger than expected strength of the association between the predictors and the outcome (b&gt1; “underfitting”) of the model. The c-index (c; between 0.5 and 1) indicates the discriminative ability of the model, that is the ability to separate low-risk from high-risk patients.</p>
