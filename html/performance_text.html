       <p style="font-size:15px;">The evaluation metrics are all based on leave-one-hospital-out cross-validation, that is, the prediction model is tested consecutively in each hospital, while the prediction model is fitted on data from the other hospitals. Calibration plots visualize the agreement between predicted and observed 21-day mortality / ICU admission in five equally-sized groups of predicted risk. The calibration intercept (a; ideally a=0) indicates the level of average underestimation (a&gt0) or overestimation (a&lt0) of the model.The calibration slope (b; ideally b=1) indicates a weaker than expected strength of the association between the predictors and the outcome (b&lt1; “overfitting”) or a stronger than expected strength of the association between the predictors and the outcome (b&gt1; “underfitting”) of the model. The c-index (c; between 0.5 and 1) indicates the discriminative ability of the model, that is the ability to separate low-risk from high-risk patients.</p>
