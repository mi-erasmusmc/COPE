# 1 Testing supporting functions

This set of tests evaluates the functions used to support the server
function. These functions are used for calculating relevant quantities,
e.g.Â 28-day mortality risk.

Function `createModelMatrix` creates the model matrix based on a set of
covariates and a list of transformations.

``` r
transformationsMortality <- list(
    age             = identity,
    respiratoryRate = log,
    crp             = log,
    ldh             = log,
    albumin         = log,
    urea            = log
)


testthat::test_that(
    "Creation of model matrix works",
    {
        testthat::expect_equal(
            createModelMatrix(
                covariates      = rep(1, 6),
                transformations = transformationsMortality
            ),
            c(1, rep(0, 5))
        )
    }
)
```

Function `createLinearPredictor` calculates the linear predictor of a
prediction based on a provided model matrix, a vector of \(\beta\)
coefficients and an intercept

``` r
testthat::test_that(
    "Creation of linear predictor works",
    {
        testthat::expect_equal(
            createLinearPredictor(
                modelMatrix = rep(1, 6),
                beta        = rep(1, 6),
                intercept   = 1
            ),
            matrix(7)
        )
    }
)
```

    ## Test passed

Function `logisticProbability` calculates the logistic probability (%)
based on a provided linear predictor value.

``` r
testthat::test_that(
    "Logistic probability calculation from linear predictor works",
    {
        testthat::expect_equal(
            logisticProbability(0),
            50
        )
    }
)
```

    ## Test passed

Finally, function `extractQuantiles` extracts the required quantiles for
the calibration plot, based on the stored dataframe of
`calibrationQuantiles`, the outcome of interest and the hospital under
consideration.

``` r
testthat::test_that(
    "Extraction of calibration quantiles works",
    {
        testthat::expect_equal(
            extractQuantiles(
                outcome              = 1,
                center               = 1,
                calibrationQuantiles = data.frame(
                    center  = 1,
                    outcome = 1,
                    quant20 = 20,
                    quant40 = 40,
                    quant60 = 60,
                    quant80 = 80
                )
            ),
            c(
                quant20 = 20, quant40 = 40,
                quant60 = 60, quant80 = 80
            )
        )
    }
)
```

# 2 Testing server functions

Here we perform a set of unit tests to ensure that server-side
operations work the way they should. We start by looking at calculations
tasks run within the server function.

## 2.1 Interactivity

Interactive values, are server-side variables that depend on the input
and, therefore, need to be updated whenever the user alters their
selection.

First, the `currentInputData` reactive dataframe should contain all the
provided inputs and should update accordingly, when these are changed.

``` r
shiny::testServer(
    expr = {
        session$setInputs(
            age                       = 70,
            respiratoryRate           = 19,
            ldh                       = 244,
            crp                       = 48,
            albumin                   = 39,
            urea                      = 6.5,
            calculatePredictionButton = "click"
        )
        
        testthat::test_that(
            "The reactive input dataframe is correct",
            {
                testthat::expect_equal(
                    currentInputData(),
                    data.frame(
                        age             = 70,
                        respiratoryRate = 19,
                        crp             = 48,
                        ldh             = 244,
                        albumin         = 39,
                        urea            = 6.5
                    )
                )
            }
        )
        
        session$setInputs(
            age                       = 70,
            respiratoryRate           = 19,
            ldh                       = 2440,
            crp                       = 48,
            albumin                   = 39,
            urea                      = 6.5,
            calculatePredictionButton = "click"
        )
        
        testthat::test_that(
            "The reactive input dataframe is updated",
            {
                testthat::expect_equal(
                    currentInputData(),
                    data.frame(
                        age             = 70,
                        respiratoryRate = 19,
                        crp             = 48,
                        ldh             = 2440,
                        albumin         = 39,
                        urea            = 6.5
                    )
                )
            }
        )
        
    }

Next, we do the same for the variables that keep track of the current
prediction and its placement, relevant to the overall predicted risk
fifths, for both outcomes (mortality and ICU admission).The first set of
tests evaluates if the initial input is handled appropriately and the
second set evaluates if the values are updated correctly.

shiny::testServer(
    expr = {
        session$setInputs(

## 2.2 Handling input admissibility

There are constraints on the input a user can provide. More
specifically, all inputs need to be numeric and should be between the
following limits:

| Predictor        | Minimum | Maximum |
| :--------------- | ------: | ------: |
| Age              |       0 |     100 |
| Respiratory rate |      10 |      60 |
| LDH              |      50 |    4000 |
| CRP              |       1 |     500 |
| Albumin          |      10 |      60 |
| Urea             |       1 |      80 |

For each input we test ensure that input is accepted when the above
rules are followed and that it is ruled as non-admissible if the
submitted number is outside the boundaries or if it is a character
string.

``` r
shiny::testServer(
    expr = {
        session$setInputs(
            age                       = -1,
